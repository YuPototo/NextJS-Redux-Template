# NextJS + Redux Toolkit + TailwindCSS

Based on [NextJS Redux Template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux).

My Change:

-   Upgrade React to latest version
-   Upgrade Redux to latest version
-   Add TailwindCSS
-   Add eslint
-   Add prettier

In this setup, Redux should only be used in client. Server has no knowledge of any client store states.
